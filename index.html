				<section><b>Open-source software (OSS)</b> is a type of computer software in which source code is released 
					under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change,
					 and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>History</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						In the early days of computing, programmers and developers shared software in order to learn from each other 
						and evolve the field of computing. Eventually, the open-source notion moved to the way side of commercialization of software in the years 1970-1980.
						 However, academics still often developed software collaboratively. For example Donald Knuth in 1979 with the TeX typesetting system or
						 Richard Stallman in 1984 with the GNU operating system. 
					</section>
					<section>
						In 1997, Eric Raymond published The Cathedral and the Bazaar, a reflective analysis of the hacker community and free-software principles.

					</section>
					<section> 
						The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating Netscape Communications Corporation to release their popular Netscape Communicator Internet suite as free software. 
						This source code subsequently became the basis behind SeaMonkey, Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and KompoZer.
					</section>
					<section>
						Netscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the Free Software Foundation's free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry. 
						They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, 
						and looked for a way to rebrand the free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code. 
						The new term they chose was "open source", which was soon adopted by Bruce Perens, publisher Tim O'Reilly, Linus Torvalds, and others.
					</section>
					<section>
						The <b>open source</b> label came out of a strategy session held on April 7, 1998 in Palo Alto in reaction to Netscape's 
						January 1998 announcement of a source code release for Navigator (as Mozilla). 
						A group of individuals at the session included Tim O'Reilly, Linus Torvalds, Tom Paquin, Jamie Zawinski, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, 
						Sameer Parekh, Eric Allman, Greg Olson, Paul Vixie, John Ousterhout, Guido van Rossum, Philip Zimmermann, John Gilmore and Eric S. Raymond. 
						They used the opportunity before the release of Navigator's source code to clarify a potential confusion caused by the ambiguity of the word "free" in English.
					</section>
					<section>
						The <b>Open Source Initiative</b> was founded in February 1998 to encourage use of the new term and evangelize open-source principles.
						<br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Opensource.svg" style="width:40%; height:40%"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						While the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to, commercial software vendors found themselves 
						increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's source code. 
						A Microsoft executive publicly stated in 2001 that "open source is an intellectual property destroyer. 
						I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business."
					</section>
					<section>
						However, while Free and open-source software has historically played a role outside of the mainstream of private software development, 
						companies as large as Microsoft have begun to develop official open-source presences on the Internet. IBM, Oracle, Google and State Farm 
						are just a few of the companies with a serious public stake in today's competitive open-source market. 
						There has been a significant shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of free and open-source software.

					<h2>Movement / Ideology</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						The <b>open-source-software movement</b> is a movement that supports the use of open-source 
						licenses for some or all software, a part of the broader notion of open collaboration. 
						The open-source movement was started to spread the concept/idea of open-source software. 
						Programmers who support the open-source-movement philosophy contribute to the open-source community 
						by voluntarily writing and exchanging programming code for software development.
					</section>
					<section>
						The open-source movement is branched from the <b>free-software movement</b> which began in the late 80s with the launching of the GNU project 
						by Richard Stallman.
						<br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Richard_Stallman_-_F%C3%AAte_de_l%27Humanit%C3%A9_2014_-_010.jpg" style="width:30%; height:30%" />
					</section>
					<section style="font-size:0.85em">
						Stallman is regarded within the open-source community as sharing a key role in the conceptualization of freely-shared source code for software development. 
						The term "free software" in the free software movement is meant to imply freedom of software exchange and modification. 
						The term does not refer to any monetary freedom. Both the free-software movement and the open-source movement share this view of free exchange 
						of programming code, and this is often why both of the movements are sometimes referenced in literature as part of the FOSS or "Free and Open Software" or FLOSS "Free/Libre Open-Source" communities.
					</section>
					<section>
						These movements share fundamental differences in the view on open software. The main, factionalizing difference between the groups is the relationship between open-source and proprietary software. 
						Often, makers of proprietary software, such as Microsoft, may make efforts to support open-source software to remain competitive. 
						Members of the open-source community are willing to coexist with the makers of proprietary software and feel that the issue of whether software is open source is a matter of practicality.
					</section>
					<section style="font-size:0.85em">
						In contrast, members of the free-software community maintain the vision that all software is a part of freedom of speech and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust. 
						The free-software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce proprietary software. As a whole, the community refuses to support proprietary software. 
						Further there are external motivations for these developers. One motivation is that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open-source environment. 
						Another motivation is that a programmer can work on multiple projects that they find interesting and enjoyable. Programming in the open-source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into the venture capital community. 
						These are just a few reasons why open-source programmers continue to create and advance software.
					</section>
					<section>
						The <b>Open Source Initiative (OSI)</b> is a California public benefit corporation, founded in 1998. 
						It promotes the usage of Open Source Software.
						<br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Opensource.svg" style="width:30%; height:30%"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						The organization was founded in late February 1998 by Bruce Perens and Eric S. Raymond, part of a group inspired 
						by the Netscape Communications Corporation publishing the source code for its flagship Netscape Communicator product. 
						Later, in August 1998, the organization added a board of directors.

					</section>
					<section>
						Raymond was president from its founding until February 2005, followed briefly by Russ Nelson and then Michael Tiemann. 
						In May 2012, the new board elected Simon Phipps as president and in May 2015 Allison Randal was elected as president 
						when Phipps stepped down in preparation for the 2016 end of his Board term. Phipps became President again in September 2017.
					</section>
					<section style="font-size:0.85em">
						The group adopted the <b>Open Source Definition</b> for open-source software, based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines. 
						They also established the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as a steward organization for the movement. However, they were unsuccessful 
						in their attempt to secure a trademark for 'open source' to control the use of the term. In 2008, in an apparent effort to reform governance of the organization, 
						the OSI Board invited 50 individuals to join a "Charter Members" group; by 26 July 2008, 42 of the original invitees had accepted the invitations. 
						The full membership of the Charter Members has never been publicly revealed, and the Charter Members group communicated by way of a closed-subscription mailing list, "osi-discuss", with non-public archives.
					</section>
					<section>
						In 2012, under the leadership of OSI director and then-president Simon Phipps, the OSI began transitioning towards a membership-based governance structure. 
						The OSI initiated an Affiliate Membership program for "government-recognized non-profit charitable and not-for-profit industry associations and academic institutions anywhere in the world". 
						Subsequently, the OSI announced an Individual Membership program and listed a number of Corporate Sponsors.
					</section>
					
					<section>
						The <b>Open Source Definition</b> is a document published by the Open Source Initiative, to determine whether a software license can be labeled with the open-source certification mark. 
						The definition was taken from the exact text of the Debian Free Software Guidelines, written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens with input from the Debian developers on a private Debian mailing list. 
						The document was created 9 months before the formation of the Open Source Initiative.
					</section>
					<section>
						Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria:
					</section>
					<section>
						1. <b>Free Redistribution</b>. The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. 
						The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.
					</section>
					<section>
						2. <b>Source Code</b>. The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. 
						Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, 
						downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. 
						Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.
					</section>
					<section>
						3. <b>Derived Works</b>. The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.
					</section>
					<section>
						4. <b>Integrity of The Author's Source Code</b>. The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license 
						allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. 
						The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.
					</section>
					<section>
						5. <b>No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</b>. The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.
					</section>
					<section>
						6. <b>No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</b>. The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. 
						For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.
					</section>
					<section>
						7. <b>Distribution of License</b>. The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.
					</section>
					<section>
						8. <b>License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</b>. The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. 
						If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is 
						redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.
					</section>
					<section>
						9. <b>License Must Not Restrict Other Software</b>. The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. 
						For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.
					</section>
					<section>
						10. <b>License Must Be Technology-Neutral</b>. No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
