						<h1>History</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						In the early days of computing, programmers and developers shared software in order to learn from each other 
						and evolve the field of computing. Eventually, the open-source notion moved to the way side of commercialization of software in the years 1970-1980.
						 However, academics still often developed software collaboratively. For example Donald Knuth in 1979 with the TeX typesetting system or
						 Richard Stallman in 1983 with the GNU operating system. 
					</section>
					<section>
						In 1997, Eric Raymond published The Cathedral and the Bazaar, a reflective analysis of the hacker community and free-software principles. 
						 The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating Netscape Communications Corporation to release their popular Netscape Communicator Internet suite as free software. 
						 This source code subsequently became the basis behind SeaMonkey, Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and KompoZer.
